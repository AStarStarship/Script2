> **🚀 We are calling all pioneers!** We are building a new foundation for software, and we need your help to build the next generation of **Games, Apps, and AI**. [Join the Mission](#join-the-mission) below.

## What is Script2?

Script2 is a high-performance, cross-platform implementation of the **SCRIPT Specification** (Serial Chinese Room, Interprocess, and Telemetry).

We are remaining the C++ ecosystem by replacing the standard library with a modern, embedded-friendly alternative. Script2 is designed for **Webapps**, **Games**, **Artificial Intelligence**, and **Distributed Systems** where performance, determinism, and precise memory control are paramount.

### Why Script2?

*   **⚡ Ultra-Fast Performance:** Our **Uniprinter** and custom **ASCII Data Types** are optimized for CPU cache performance, replacing slow standard library components like `printf` and `std::string` with blazing fast alternatives.
*   **🧠 Built for AI & Logic:** Modeled after the *Chinese Room Thought Experiment*, our architecture treats data processing as a conversation of symbols (the Chinese Room Abstract Stack Machine or "Crabs"), making it uniquely suited for AI agents and complex telemetry.
*   **🎮 Game Engine Ready:** With optional dynamic memory and no garbage collection pauses, Script2 provides the low-level control required for high-performance game engines.
*   **🛠️ Modern Embedded-C++:** A clean slate. We use a simplified **Kabuki Module** format and custom containers (`Array`, `List`, `Stack`) to create a robust, dependency-free environment.

## Join the Mission

We are an ambitious open-source project looking for volunteers who want to learn deep C++ and help shape a new ecosystem. Whether you are a veteran systems engineer or a student looking to learn, there is a place for you here.

We need help with:
*   **Webapp Development:** Building cross-platform app libraries with async IO and that easily map to any programming language and operate across assembly line boundaries.
*   **Game Development:** Building demos, physics integrations, and rendering loops using Script2.
*   **AI Integration:** Implementing the Chinese Room logic and linear ID systems.
*   **Core Systems:** optimizing our custom memory allocators and data structures.
*   **Community & Docs:** Helping others understand the ASCII Chinese Room philosophy.

**"I've been working on this specification for a long time, and I am looking for a community to help bring this vision to life. I worked for many years to make the ASCII Data Specification make sense for creating a Chinese Room, and it would be a lot of fun to make some modern AI, games, and apps with it."** — *AStarCale, Founder/Code Monkey*

👉 **Ready to help?** Check out our [Good First Issues](https://github.com/AStarStarship/Script2/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) or introduce yourself in the Discussions!

## Key Features

*   **ASCII Data Specification:** An Abstract Data Type Specification defining a contiguous memory layout optimized for Data Driven Design and Development.
*   **Uniprinter:** Ultra-fast Unicode string processing featuring the [Puff Algorithm](https://github.com/AStarStarship/Script2/wiki/Fastest-Method-to-Print-Integers-and-Floating-point-Numbers), the world's fastest integer-to-string algorithm that uses discrete math to eliminate over half the division instructions of the industry-standard mod 100 div 100 loop.
*   **Seam Testing:** A low-cost, in-order tree-based unit test framework for Agile and Issue Driven Development.

## Documentation

*   [SCRIPT Specification](./Spec/) - *Release for Comment for Serial Chinese Room, Interprocess, and Telemetry (SCRIPT) Specification.*

### Quickstart

1.  **Set Breakpoints:** Open `Test.hpp` and set a breakpoint in the first function where the comment instructs. This allows us to capture the stack frame programmatically.
2.  **Setup Workspace:** Copy the `_Seams` directory to your workspace and rename the folder to your liking.
3.  **Run Tests:** Delete unneeded seams and modify the `COut` seam test to suit your project.
