# Strings

Unicode strings can be created two different ways, using ASCII Strings and ASCII SRopes (String Rope). Strings can be created out of an ASCII Stack of Characters (i.e. CHA, CHB, or CHC POD Types), and this string type doesn't keep track of the number of Unicode characters. SRopes are created using the Extended Mappable Types, and they are used to keep track of the number of Unicode Characters and thus are only valid for UTF-8 and UTF-16 strings but not valid for UTF-32 strings because they are not encoded. SRopes are composed of an ISZ datum that can be used to store anything, typically a neural network value, followed by an ISZ charc (character count), followed by an ASCII String.

```C++
/* A ASCII string created from an ASCII Stack that doesn't keep track of the 
number of Unicode characters. */
template<SND_A>
struct TString {
  ISZ total,  //< Total elements in the boofer.
      count;  //< Count of characters in the boofer.
};

/* A UTF-8 or UTF-16 ASCII string created from an ASCII Stack that keeps track 
of the number of Unicode characters. */
template<STR_A>
struct TRope {
  ISZ datum,  //< Memory alignment datum can be used for multiple purposes.
      charc,  //< Unicode Character Count.
      total,  //< Size of the string in bytes including the header.
      count;  //< Count of elements in the boofer.
};
```

```Script2
STA utf8_example: "ðŸ¥œDez nutzðŸ¥œ"
STB utf16_example: "ðŸ¥œDez nutzðŸ¥œ"
STC utf32_example: "ðŸ¥œDez nutzðŸ¥œ"

SRA utf8_example: "ðŸ¥œDez nutzðŸ¥œ"
SRB utf16_example: "ðŸ¥œDez nutzðŸ¥œ"
SRC utf32_example: "ðŸ¥œYou guessed it bois... dez nutz!ðŸ¥œ"
```
