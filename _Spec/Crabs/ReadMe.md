# [SCRIPT Specification](../)

## [Crabs Specification](./)

The **Chinese Room Abstract Stack Machine** (**Crabs**) is an abstract machine capable of running *Group Automata* using the SCRIPT Protocol and Script^2. Crabs is the standardized Script^2 API for interacting with a Chinese Room with a text terminal over the Script. Script is designed to run over a standard serial connection that allows users to hack on devices in real-time with a PC keyboard, app GUI, or other serial B-Stream so Script makes use of ASCII C0 Codes and VK Keyboard Codes so you can do alt, shift, or control keys on the keyboard to do stuff like copy and paste and Script Macros.
