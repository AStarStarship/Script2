## [Distributed Nomination System](readme.md)

The **ICAN3 Distributed Nomination Systems** (**ICAN3 DNS**) is a technology for the fair promotion of unique key domains to the **Global Namespace** (i.e. ".com websites"). It's designed to make corporate control of the .com a domain a thing of the past. In ICAN3 DNS, keys without and .tags are Global in scopes, meaning they go to the DNS Authorities for that planet.

## 5.3 ICAN3 DNS Authority Hierarchy

The *International Council of Artificial and Natural Neural Nets (ICAN3) DNS Authority* operates under the key **ican3.gov**. ICAN3 is a massively parallel AI supercomputer Chinese Room and Group Automata distributed around the universe. ICAN3 uses Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AIML) to optimize the internet and provide free and democratized AIML to the world through *International Internet Service Providers (IISP)*. *IISPs* provide supercomputer time for the **ICAN3 Authorities**. Each *IISP* and it's subscribers are a member of a *Internet Guild* as well as the *ICAN3 Governance*, which is in turn governed by the local government in that *GCG Guild*. If multiple governments have land claims in that grid, all governments will be part of that *GCG Guild*.
