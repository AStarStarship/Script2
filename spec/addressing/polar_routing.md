### Polar Routing

It is not possible for any router to be located at the exact center of a 1 degree latitude by 1 degree longitude grid, nor does it need to be because there are a manageably small number of fiber optics cables to route and thus the center of the grid is defined as the fastest internet connection in that Degree Grid. All other organizations that provide the internet backbone are then referenced again in polar coordinates from the Degree Grid Reference.
