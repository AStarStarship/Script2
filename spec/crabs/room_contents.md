### Room Contents

A Chinese Room in John Searle's famous thought experiment is just a plain old office with a person in it who is operating a *pen and paper abstract stack machine* that functions identically to computer, only there are no electronic parts. In this room are Doors that lead to other rooms that have people in them. Each Door has a Slot (i.e. a socket) that allows people in rooms to communicate with other rooms with handwritten messages that can be both synchronous and asynchronous. Consequentially, this is exactly how an optimized piece of internet software works. Rooms consist of Doors that lead to other Rooms, Walls that contain Doors, Slots in Doors, One-way Tables, Books, Dictionaries, Maps, Lists, Arrays, Stacks, and Files, and Boxes.

At the root scope of each system lies a *Interrupt Operations* DC1, DC2, DC3, and DC4 Script Operations defined.

#### Walls

**Walls** are contiguous blocks of word-aligned memory used to construct Chinese Rooms out of. Walls are used to install Doors, Filing Cabinets, Book Shelves, Windows, Mirrors, and Tables.

#### Doors

**Doors** in a *Chinese Rooms* are a kMAP ASCII Data Type.

##### Front Door

Front Doors are known entrances to the Room.

##### Backdoor Door

Back-doors are unknown entrances to the Room.

#### Mirrors and Windows

**Mirrors** in a *Chinese Rooms* are *Contiguous Word-Aligned Memory Blocks* used for *Expressions* and *Interprocess IO Portals* that use *Word-Aligned Hashless B-Sequences*. When two one-way Mirrors are combined they create a duplex Slot called a **Window**. Mirror and Windows shall be used to for Interprocess Same-System Terminals.
