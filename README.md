The Serial Chinese Room, Interprocess, and Telemetry Specification™ (SCRIPT Specification™), defines the ASCII Data Types, the Chinese Room Abstract Stack Machine™ (Crabs™), SCRIPT Protocol™, and Script2 (TM) (Script2™). Script2 is an implementation of the SCRIPT Specification that provides:

* Cross-platform Modern Embedded-C++ replacement for C++ std library featuring optional dynamic memory and simplified Kabuki Module format.
* Interprocess communication and data serialization engine modeled after AI philosophy of the Chinese Room Thought Experiment and ASCII C0 Control Codes.
* Ultra-fast Unicode string processing with the Uniprinter (Universal Printer), featuring the [Puff Algorithm](https://github.com/kabuki-starship/script2/wiki/Fastest-Method-to-Print-Integers-and-Floating-point-Numbers) and template-friendly Stringf formatting utilities to replace printf, sprintf, and sscanf.
* Unit test framework with low-cost in-order Seam tree tests for Agile, Test, and Issue Driven Development featuring debug information customized for each tree node.
* The [Automaton Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) Data Specification](./spec/data/readme.md) is an Abstract Data Type Specification that defines a contiguous memory layout and test suite optimized for CPU cache performance.
* The [ASCII C++ Style Guide](./style_guide/readme.md) is a divergent fork of the Google C++ Style Guide that uses ASCII Data Types and intelligent rules to dramatically reduced clutter and improved readability.
