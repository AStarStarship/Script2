# SCRIPT Script

![Under Construction Image](https://github.com/kabuki-starship/kabuki_toolkit/wiki/under_construction.png)

Serial Chinese Room, Interprocess, and Telemetry (SCRIPT) Specification defines A family of technologies, collectively referred to as Script, that are built on the Chinese Room Abstract Stack Machine (Crabs), SCRIPT Protocol, and SCRIPT Script (Script^2 or Script2) and provides:

* Replacement for C++ std library suitable for embedded systems.
* Seam Trees provide low-cost in-order unit tests for Agile, Test, and Issue Driven Development with debug information customized for each tree node.
* Cross-platform Modern `Embedded-C++11` IoT Nanoframework with Cross-language C Application Binary Interface (ABI) and minimal Doxygen API docs.
* ASCII Data Types and the ASCII Factory operate seamlessly across assembly boundary with optimal RAM usage and CPU cache performance from ROM-able ASCII Contiguous Objects.
* Rapid compile time using 3-file Translation Units with unique names and separated C++ templates.
* Modeled after AI philosophy and ASCII mimicry of the Chinese Room Thought Experiment and C0 Control Codes.
* ASCII C++ Style Guide is a modified version of the Google C++ Style Guide that incorperates the ASCII Data Types and Seam Tree Tests.

## ASCII Data Types

Automaton Standard Code for Information Interchange Data Types provide:

* All of the C++ POD types.
* Year 2038-safe 32-bit, 64- bit and dual-32-bit with 32-year epoch and sub-second tick timestamps.
* All data types are optionally 64-bit aligned so they may be rapidly copied from one system to another on homo-endian system.
* Optional MSB variant encoding provides fast data compression similar to UTF-8.
* Convenient and easy-to-read-and-type 3-letter all-caps abbreviations that POP out around lower_snake_case.
* Contiguous Objects
  * 16-bit ASCII Data Words allow for up to 64K different map combinations.
  * UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32 strings.
  * Array - A multidimensional array with Stack of dimensions.
  * Vector - A stack of POD types in the form of a bounded-sized array.
  * Loom - A homogeneous array of UTF-8, UTF-16, or UTF-32 strings.
  * B-Sequence - Describes the order and maximum sizes of a Byte-Sequence of ASCII Data.
  * Maps - Maps can be created of any of the POD, String, or Loom to any type, including nested Maps.
	  * Table - A hash table of contiguous mappings (Loom-to-ContiguousMap).
	  * Book - A multidictionary (i.e. unordered map) of Loom-to-Wildcard without hash table.
	  * Dictionary - A dictionary of ASCII Data Types with hash table.
  * Expression - Asynchronous Chinese Room Expressions capable of concurrently executing scripts in multiple languages with interrupts.
