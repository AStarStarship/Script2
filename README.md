The Serial Chinese Room, Interprocess, and Telemetry (SCRIPT) Specification defines the ASCII Data Types, the Chinese Room Abstract Stack Machine (Crabs), SCRIPT Protocol, and SCRIPT Script (Script2). Script2 is an implementation of the SCRIPT Specification that provides:

* Cross-platform Modern Embedded-C++ replacement for C++ std library featuring optional dynamic memory.
* Interprocess communication and data serialization engine modeled after AI philosophy of the Chinese Room Thought Experiment and ASCII C0 Control Codes.
* Ultra-fast Unicode string processing with the Uniprinter (Universal Printer), featuring the [Puff Algorithm](https://github.com/kabuki-starship/script2/wiki/Fastest-Method-to-Print-Integers-and-Floating-point-Numbers) and template-friendly Stringf formatting utilities to replace printf, sprintf, and sscanf.
* Unit test framework with low-cost in-order Seam tree tests for Agile, Test, and Issue Driven Development featuring debug information customized for each tree node.
* Rapid compile time using Library translation unit and wrapper classes that hide templates and large header files.
* The [Automaton Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) Data Specification](https://github.com/kabuki-starship/script2/spec/data/readme.md) is an Abstract Data Type Specification that defines a memory layout and Algebraic test contracts for concrete implementations of Abstract Data Types (ADT).
* The [ASCII C++ Style Guide](https://github.com/kabuki-starship/script2/style_guide/readme.md) is a divergent fork of the Google C++ Style Guide that uses ASCII Data Types and intelligent rules to dramatically reduced clutter and improved readability.
